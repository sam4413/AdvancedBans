IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT! NOT DONE YET!<br>
 Allows Space Engineers server owners to tempban, or permaban users, now with reasons!<br>
 All bans are stored in a Postgres Database for easy integration with other applicaitons.<br>

 ## The idea
 The idea of the plugin is to make banning users more easy to manage, and easily conveying to the user why they exactly got banned. If your running a community with 400+ members for instance, there will come a few that will break the rules. A good alternative than to ban them, and loose on a potential player forever, is to simply tempban them, basically giving them a slap on the wrist to follow the rules.
